# O.G. IMAGE

![](https://ogimage.micahrl.com/api/ogImage/og/preview/logo)

This is an og:image generator.

It is patterned after <https://github.com/vercel/og-image>, but borrowed no code from it.

## Local development

```sh
npm run dev
```

It uses port 2929 on local host, because it is expected to be run alongside other nextjs apps, which might expect to use the default port 3000.
